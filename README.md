# Algorithms_Assignment_01

<h1>This project is made by: Hallur vid Neyst, Murched Kayed, Mohammad Saad</h1>

<p>In order to run the project, first you need to have jdk 8</p>

Measure time consumtion for each algorithm and compare them , and discuss the result in a one page summary.

merge: 3.539 sekunder

insertion: 99 minutter

selection: 143 minutter

l√¶ngden er : 822287

merge:
	worstcase:, bestcase: avgcase:
O(N*(log(N)) - O(822287 * log(822287)) = 1.199.421 times.
	

insertion:
	worstcase:(O(n^2)) O(822287^2) = 676.155.910.369 times
avgcase:(O(n^2)) O(822287^2) = 676.155.910.369 times
bestcase:(O(n)) O(822287) = 8222287 times

the reason that worst case is in power of 2

 bestcase: avgcase:

selection sort:

Worst complexity: O(n2)
Average complexity:O(n2)
Best Complexity: O(n2
 (n) is the the size of the array which is 822287.

Worst complexity: 8222872 = 676155910369

Average complexity: 8222872 = 676155910369

Best Complexity: 8222872 676155910369

The result is the same in all cases, because  whatever you do with the selection Sort algorithm you can't slip from checking every element in the list, that's why it have the same number of complexity in all cases.
